# AI Agent Development
AI Agent to help startup founders identify bottlenecks in their growth system

## Project Title
**Startup Growth Advisor Agent**  
An AI-powered conversational agent that helps early-stage startup founders identify what’s stalling their growth — and offers actionable clarity.

---

## Use Case
Startup founders often feel stuck even when their team is working hard. This agent helps them diagnose the “invisible blockers” in their growth system by translating vague pain points into specific growth challenges.

> "Our product is fine, but growth is flat." → The agent helps uncover if it's retention, messaging, or feedback loop issues.

## Agent Architecture (4-Layer Design)

### 1. Input Understanding
- Translates vague founder inputs into specific symptoms.
- Detects challenges like low retention, unclear positioning, etc.

### 2. State Tracker
- Tracks user context (team size, efforts already made, etc.)
- Avoids repeating advice and personalizes interactions

### 3. Task Planner
- Internal logic:
  1. Ask clarifying questions
  2. Suggest possible causes
  3. Recommend a micro-experiment
  4. Share startup pattern (if any)

### 4. Output Generator
- Mentor-like tone with clarity, short suggestions, and a reflective question at the end.

## Sample Interaction
```text
🧑 Founder: "We’re building features but users aren’t sticking around."
🤖 Agent: "Sounds like retention is the challenge. Is drop-off happening after onboarding or deeper into the product? Try interviewing 3 users who stopped using your app — they may reveal what felt unclear. What’s the most surprising feedback you've heard so far?"
```

## Iteration Log (Prompt Tuning)
| Attempt | Prompt | Issue | Fix |
|--------|--------|-------|-----|
| #1 | “Our product is fine but no one's using it.” | Too generic | Added symptom translator |
| #2 | “We added new features, no result.” | Too shallow | Added question step in planner |
| #3 | “Growth is flat.” | Poor structure | Defined clear output sequence |

## Learnings
- Prompt design = modular thinking.
- Clarity > complexity.
- Treat ChatGPT as a teammate: ask questions, iterate, debug.
